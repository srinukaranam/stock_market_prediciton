# 📈 Stock Market Prediction

## 🔍 Overview
This project is a **stock market prediction system** that uses **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks** to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The application supports **real-time stock data fetching** using `yfinance` and features an **interactive web interface** built with Streamlit.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Real-time stock price updates** using Yahoo Finance.
- 🔥 **LSTM-based deep learning model** for predictions.
- 📈 **Interactive stock charts** powered by Plotly.
- ⏳ **Custom future predictions** (1-30 days ahead).
- ⚡ **Optimized for performance** with caching.
- 🔄 **Scalable model training** using Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/stock-market-prediction.git
cd stock-market-prediction
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Web App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📚 Usage
### **Using the Web App (`app.py`)**
1. **Enter the stock symbol** (e.g., `GOOG`).
2. **Select the number of future days** for prediction.
3. **Click 'Predict'** to see real-time stock trends.
4. **View interactive charts** comparing actual vs predicted prices.

### **Training the Model (`jupytern.ipynb`)**
1. Open the **Jupyter Notebook**.
2. Run the cells to **train the LSTM model** on real-time data.
3. The model will be saved as `stock predictions model.keras`.
4. Update `app.py` to use the new model for predictions.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- ✅ **Multi-stock predictions** (predict multiple stocks simultaneously).
- 📊 **Sentiment analysis** (integrate news-based predictions).
- ⏳ **Faster training with GPU acceleration**.
- 🤖 **More advanced AI models** (e.g., Transformer-based forecasting).
